Note: Remember you have to guide the AI with clear prompts to avoid more errors. 

The most challenging part was fixing the date error in the csv-parser.ts file which was expecting the date to be in the following format:  YYYY-MM-DD. And the CSV (Comma-Delimited) file would contain the expense data in DD-MM-YY format. This meant that both the CSV file and the parser.ts needed to be updated.  

1. Sample CSV File containing expense data:

Updated the CSV file to show the correct date format. 

Before:

<img width="526" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95312d31-9407-4dd2-911a-47cab9939e0c" />


After:

<img width="523" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a7be1c1-b369-4703-96f7-551d35555260" />

2. CSV-Parser.ts file:

Updated the parser to expect the following column names in the CSV:
"Date on Receipt", "Description of Expense", "Currency", "Type of Expense", "Payment Method", and "Payee".

If the CSV uses different headers, you'd need to adjust the mapping accordingly. The file is located in "src/services/csv-parser.ts".  

Possible area for improvement: Including error handling for malformed CSVs or invalid data types. 

Disclaimer: The code is generated by Gemini utilising typescript: react, tailwind css and genkit-cli.
